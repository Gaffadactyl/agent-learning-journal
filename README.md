# agent-learning-journal

This repository documents my hands-on apprenticeship in AI agent engineering.

## Purpose
- Learn to design and build AI agents from first principles
- Use real-world software development practices
- Build a portfolio of working systems, not demos

## Learning Principles
- Theory → See One → Do One → Teach One
- Reasoning-first evaluation
- No magical abstractions
- Production habits from day one

## Structure
- `sessions/` — session notes, tasks, and reflections
- `src/` — source code produced during the apprenticeship

## Status
This repository is actively evolving as part of a structured training program.
This is a collection of AI Learning Lessons and Agentic Projects
